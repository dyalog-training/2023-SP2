# Materials for Dyalog 23's *SP2: Development Masterclass* workshop
*AdÃ¡m Brudzewsky and Stefan Kruger (asst. John Daintree)*

> Dyalog's graphical integrated development environments (the cross-platform RIDE and Microsoft Windows-only IDE) have many useful features that can enhance your ability to develop and debug code, not all of which are immediately obvious. We'll take you on a hands-on tour in which you'll be able to use existing functionality and add your own, making you a more effective APLer.

## Workshop pre-requisites

* Dyalog v18.2 or later, any operating system, Unicode/Classic, 32/64 bit ([download here](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm?p=download))
* If you are on Linux, also install RIDE ([download here](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride/releases/latest))
